          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>I am currently enrolled as a senior in the Sumatera Institute of Technology pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a Embedded systems and Control system minor. But I also interested in the Web Development field, Data engineering and am seeking exciting opportunities related to the same. Being an inter island student, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes and gain a broader perspective. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning especially Data science. I like to solve problems logically and fix errors. I am a detail orientated person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity. I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic environment and competitive university life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive. PS : I ❤️ brew my own coffee.</p>
